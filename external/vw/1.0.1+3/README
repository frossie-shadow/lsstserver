The tar ball, vw-1.0.1+X.tar.gz (where X is an integer) included here
was constructed from a modified version of the official NASA release
of VisionWorkbench 1.0.1.  For X=3, this tar ball was constructed via
the following:

   svn co svn+ssh://svn.lsstcorp.org/vendor/vw/tags/1.0.1+3 vw-1.0.1+3
   tar czf vw-1.0.1+2.tar.gz vw-1.0.1+2

This version, 1.0.1+3, has been altered to build with boost 1.35.0
